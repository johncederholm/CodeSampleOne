# CodeSampleOne

This is the source code for the "Suicide League" app I wrote for a freelance client. 
The SL app interfaces with a PHP mobile backend (which I also wrote) for the popular fantasy football site, SuicideLeague.com.

All designs were supplied by the client and I copied them exactly.
UI, of course, takes a lot of effort, and my main app, "d2i," showcases my capacity for creating pleasant UI/UX's.

The SL app, however, is an example of my ability to fundamentally plan and create an entire project from scratch.

This project also incorporates high-level Swift topics like generics, delegates, networking/error handling, keychains, and much
more.

Please contact me at johncederholm@d2iapp.com with any questions or comments. If you would like to be put into contact with
the client, then please let me know and I will see what I can do.

Thank you for checking out my first code sample and I hope you have a great day.

John
