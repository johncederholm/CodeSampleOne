This is the source code for the "Suicide League" app I wrote for a freelance client. 
The SL app interfaces with a PHP mobile backend (which I also wrote) for the popular fantasy football site, SuicideLeague.com.

All designs were supplied by the client and I copied them exactly.
My current company's app, "d2i," showcases my capacity for creating pleasant UI/UX's.

The SL app, however, is an example of my ability to fundamentally plan and create an entire project from scratch.

This project incorporates high-level Swift topics like generics, delegates, networking/error handling, keychains, and much more.

ALL TESTS WERE REMOVED. Some tests had sensitive assertions, and removing these assertions would have made the tests useless as they would always fail.

Please contact me at johncederholm@d2iapp.com with any questions or comments. If you would like to be put into contact with
the client, then please let me know and I will see what I can do.

Thank you for checking out my first code sample and I hope you have a great day.

John
